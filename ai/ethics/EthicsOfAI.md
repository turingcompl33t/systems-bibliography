### Big Idea

The development of artificial intelligence will likely produce cognitive systems that have moral status. This introduces new ethical problems both with respect to how these systems interact with humans and how we treat these systems.

### Summary

This paper takes an approach towards addressing the problems of ethics in artificial intelligence by proceeding in terms of increasing power:

- For "weak" AI systems (such as those that we have access to at the time of this writing), ethical implications emerge as a result of using these systems to make decisions in the real world that have consequence for humans. The authors recognize the need for certain properties like transparency and robustness in the face of this use case.
- These weak AI systems will operate in more foreign (out of distribution) contexts as time goes on. This implies the need for a new set of engineering practices that take ethical considerations into account.
- Strong AI systems with advanced cognitive abilities will have moral status. This implies a need to extend our current "science of ethics" to encompass these systems. "Minds with exotic properties" introduce interesting challenges.
- The prospect of building smarter-than-human superintelligent AI systems introduces the need to design the systems such that the can achieve superethical behavior.
